    <h1>Pomodoro Timer</h1>
    <p> A Pomodoro Timer is a tool that uses the Pomodoro Technique, a time management 
        technique that helps people manage their time and help improve focus and productivity. It
        marks off 25-minute work intervals, known as pomodoros that are seperated by 5-minute breaks.
        The Pomodoro Technique helps you concentrate on different tasks for fixed intervals and after
        four pomodoros, you can take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.</p>
