Description: The user will be alerted when his 25 minute focus session(a pomodoro) is up and will take a 5 minute break and then continue working on the task he was working on before or another task for another 25 minutes. This will continue for up to 4 pomodoros and then the user can take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This will keep on continuing as long as the user wants to use the Pomodoro Technique which is a technique that helps people manage their time and help improve their focus and productivity.
